Individual Reflection week 1:

1) For next week I would like to be better at continuously communicating between the 
different programing pairs to avoid confusion when it comes time to put our work together.
I also hope to get more comfortable with the best practices for flutter since it is a new language.

2) My contributions were related to the discussion and then mainly towards the projects 
backend development. I worked to integrate the weather api, handle the json it returned 
and then parse it into a format that we could deliver to the front end for use. 
Next sprint I hope to do a better job at documenting my work.
